📋 **Features**  
Starlight Relay is packed with features designed to impress and perform.  
 * 🎨 Futuristic Anime/Sci-Fi Theme: A gorgeous UI with a dynamic, animated starfield background.  
 * 🖱️ Interactive 3D Tilt & Parallax: The UI card responds to your mouse movement, creating a stunning sense of depth.  
 * ✨ Polished Animations: From a subtle title glitch to a pulsing "Warp" button, the interface feels alive.  
 * ⚡ Engaging User Feedback: The button transforms into a loading state upon submission, confirming the user's action.  
 * 📱 Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.  
 * ☁️ Serverless on the Edge: Deployed on Cloudflare Workers for incredible speed and reliability.  
 * 🔧 Easy to Deploy & Customize: Get your own proxy running in under 5 minutes with a single script.  
<br>  

🛠️ **How It Works**  
The magic is surprisingly simple, thanks to the power of Cloudflare Workers.  
 * Landing Page: A user visits the root URL and is greeted by the animated UI, rendered from HTML and CSS within the worker script.  
 * User Input: The user enters a target URL (e.g., https://example.com) into the form.  
 * Client-Side "Warp": On submission, client-side JavaScript intercepts the request, URI-encodes the target URL, and redirects the user to a path on the worker itself (e.g., /{worker-url}/https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com).  
 * Edge-Side Relay: The Cloudflare Worker receives this new request, decodes the path back into the target URL, and fetches the content directly from the edge.  
 * Content Streaming: The worker then streams the fetched content back to the user, effectively acting as a high-speed relay.

🚀 **Deployment Guide**  
Get your own instance of Starlight Relay live in just a few steps.  

**Prerequisites**  
 * A free Cloudflare account.  

**Step-by-Step Instructions**  
 * Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.  
 * In the left-hand sidebar, navigate to Workers & Pages.  
 * Click on Create application, then Create Worker.  
 * Give your worker a unique name (e.g., starlight-relay-yourname). This will be part of its URL.  
 * Click Deploy.  
 * Once deployed, click Edit code.  
 * Delete all the boilerplate code in the editor.  
 * Copy the entire JavaScript code for the Starlight Relay project.  
 * Paste it into the now-empty Cloudflare editor.  
 * Click the Save and Deploy button.  

That's it! Your personal web proxy is now live and accessible at the URL provided.

🎨 **Customization**  
It's easy to make Starlight Relay your own. All the configuration is at the top of the script.  

 * **Change the Name**: Simply modify the `BRAND_NAME` constant at the top of the script.  
   ```js
   const BRAND_NAME = "Your Custom Name";
   ```

 * **Change the Theme**: All visual styles are contained within the `DEFAULT_CSS` constant. You can change colors, fonts, animations, and more by editing the CSS values inside this string. For example, to change the primary glow color from pink to a bright blue:  
   * Find instances of `#EC4899` (the pink color).  
   * Replace them with your desired color, e.g., `#00BFFF` (Deep Sky Blue).
